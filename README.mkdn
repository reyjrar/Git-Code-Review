# NAME

Git::Code::Review - Tools for performing code review using Git as the backend

# VERSION

version 2.2

# SYNOPSIS

This module installs a new command to allow you to perform a tracked code review
using a git repository as the storage and communication medium for the audit.

This is intended to be used as a **post-commit** code review tool.

# INSTALL

Recommended install with [CPAN Minus](http://cpanmin.us):

    cpanm Git::Code::Review

You can also use CPAN:

    cpan Git::Code::Review

This will take care of ensuring all the dependencies are satisfied and will install the scripts into the same
directory as your Perl executable.

## USAGE

The utility ships with documentation.

    git-code-review help

And each command has a basic overview of it's own options and uses.

    git-code-review help init
    git-code-review help select
    git-code-review help profile
    git-code-review help list
    git-code-review help pick
    git-code-review help comment
    git-code-review help fixed
